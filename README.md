# SegPC-2021-PyTorch
- SegPC is short for [Segmentation of Multiple Myeloma Plasma Cells](https://segpc-2021.grand-challenge.org/)
- Challenge: Instance Segmentation of Plasma Cell of Interest

### Data Cleaning
I trained 5 models for semantic segmentation of PC (5-fold in nnUNet training), and manully corrected reference labels.
